            <li><em>1 cup brown sugar</em> packed</li>
            <li><em>1-3 teaspoons cinnamon</em> ground</li>
            <li><em>2-4 tablespoons butter</em> COLD, cubed</li>
            <li><em>cooking spray</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Instructions</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get out and measure your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cut your pineapple into spears.</li>
            <li>Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a large resealable 
                bag.
            </li>
            <li>Add the pineapple spears and close the bag tightly.</li>
            <li>Shake it so that the cinnamon and brown sugar completely 
                coat the spears. Press sugar mixture onto spears as you remove 
                from bag.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Prepare a rimmed baking sheet 
                with a tin foil and a light coating of cooking spray. Set 
                aside.
            </li>
            <li>Place coated pineapple on prepared baking sheet in a single 
                layer. Place tiny butter cubes across the top of the pineapple 
                spears.
            </li>
            <li>Place prepared pineapple spears directly on top of the grill, 
                with or without a skewer stuck inside it lengthwise. Just like a 
                big pineapple popsicle or lollipop.
            </li>
            <li>Cook covered until soft and lightly charred; 2-3 minutes per 
                side, depending on the thickness of your pineapple.
            </li>
        </ol>
