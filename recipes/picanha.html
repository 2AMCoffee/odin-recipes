    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    <p>Picanha <em>pronounced pi-kan-yah</em> is a tender and juicy cut of beef from the 
    rump section of the cow. It has a thick layer of fat called the fat cap that lends the 
    beef its incredible flavor.
    </p>
    <p>If you've ever been to a Portuguese or Brazilian steakhouse, you've had churrasco 
        picanha!It is the delicious steak served tableside on skewers and sliced on your 
        plate. It is absolutely amazing and so hard to resist every time they come around 
        with it.
    </p>
    <p>Like sirloin, picanha steak is very flavorful, buttery, and tender. It is a specialty 
        of Brazilian <em>churrascaria</em> (steakhouses) and is one of the most delectable 
        churrasco steak recipes.
    </p>
    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>3-4 pound Picanha cut sirloin cap</em></li>
        <li><em>1 tablespoon Santa Maria seasoning rub</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Instructions</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat grill to high (around 400 degrees F). While the grill is heating, prepare 
            the Picanha. Using a knife, score the fat cap of the Picanha in a crosshatched 
            pattern making sure to not cut too deep past the fate into the meat.
        </li>
        <li>Next, season the fat cap with the Santa Maria seasoning rub, reserving about 1
            tablespoon.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the picanha into 1-inch strips. Then, fold each strip into the shape of the 
            letter "C" and slide onto metal skewers.
        </li>
        <li>You'll want to grill the sirloin steaks over indirect heat so if needed, turn one 
            side of the burners off the grill, or rearrange the hot coals to one side so you 
            can grill over indirect heat. Place the skewers onto the grill and grill for 
            15-20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, until the steaks reach the desired level of 
            doneness.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the grill and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
